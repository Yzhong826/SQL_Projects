# SQL_Projects

Hi, welcome to my SQL projects repository. The repository contains examples of SQL I've written for solo projects building my foundations up with data analytics and coding with SQL. Below are a few highlighted projects. I hope you enjoy the storytelling element as much as I did through these databases, and feel free to [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yang-zhong/) if you have any feedback or questions you want to know about the data!
